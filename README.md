This projects contains plots showing evolution of averaged input frequencies of &#945;-asynchronous ECAs 
as &#945; changes. Plots for 88 independent ECAs are prepared with different choices of &#945;:
<ul>
<li>&#945;=0.1,0.2,...,1.0 - plots are in the <b>fig</b> directory</li>
<li>&#945;=0.01,0.02,...,1.0 - plots are in the <b>fig001</b> directory</li>
</ul>

The project has also source data based on which plots can be generated as well as two python scripts for generating plots.
To generate plots execute:
<br/>
<code>
python graphs_creator.py
</code>
<br/>
or
<br/>
<code>
python graphs_creator001.py
</code>

Scripts use numpy and matplotlib.
